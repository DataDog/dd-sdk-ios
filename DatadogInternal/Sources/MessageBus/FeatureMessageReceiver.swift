/// The `FeatureMessageReceiver` defines an interface for a Feature to receive messages
/// from a bus that is shared between Features registered to same instance of the core.
///
/// The message is composed of a key and a dictionary of attributes. The message format is a loose
/// agreement between Features - all messages supported by a Feature should be properly documented.

    /// Receives messages from the message bus.
    ///
    /// The message can be used to build an event or execute custom routine in the Feature.

    /// This method is always called on the same thread managed by core. If the implementation
    /// of `FeatureMessageReceiver` needs to manage a state it can consider its mutations started
    /// from `receive(message:from:)` to be thread-safe. The implementation should be mindful of
    /// not blocking the caller thread to not delay processing of other messages in the system.
