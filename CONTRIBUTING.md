## Have a patch?

We welcome all code contributions to the library. If you have a patch adding value to the SDK, let us know üí™! Before you [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-ios/pull/new/master), make sure that you first create an Issue to explain the bug or the feature your patch covers, then make sure similar Issue or PR doesn't already exist.

Your Pull Request will be run through our CI pipeline, and a project member will review the changes with you. At a minimum, to be accepted and merged, Pull Requests must:

- have a stated goal and detailed description of the changes made;
- include thorough test coverage and documentation, where applicable;
- pass all tests and code quality checks on CI;
- receive at least one approval from a project member with push permissions.

Make sure that your code is clean and readable, that your commits are small and atomic, with a proper commit message.

## Shall we start?

üèó The easiest way to start is to run `make` command:

```bash
$ make
```

### Repo structure

#### `Datadog.xcworkspace`

The workspace for SDK development and integration (tests, benchmarks, example app).

#### Sources

`Datadog` source files

#### Tests

`DatadogTests` (unit tests), `IntegrationTests`, and `DatadogBenchmarkTests` (benchmarks) source files

#### Lint

We're using `swiftlint` to ensure our codebase follows Swift standard syntax. You can run the lint with our custom rules with the following command line:

```shell
$ ./tools/lint/run-linter.sh
```

In order to apply automatic correction of violations use `--fix` flag:

```shell
$ ./tools/lint/run-linter.sh --fix
```

#### Dependency manager tests

Isolated example apps using `cocoapods`, `carthage` and `spm` to ensure SDK is well integrated with all supported dependency managers.
