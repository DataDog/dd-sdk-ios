/// Single-Feature core mock is a `PassthroughCoreMock` with the ability to register
/// a single Feature instance.

/// The Single-Feature can be useful if you need to register and retrieve a Feature during tests.
///
/// Usage:
///
///         let feature = MyCustomFeature()
///         let core = SingleFeatureCoreMock(feature: feature)
///         core.scope(for: "my-custom-feature")?.eventWriteContext { context, writer in
///             // will open a scope for the custom Feature only.
///         }
///
/// The Single-Feature core allow registering and retrieving a single Feature type.
///
///     let feature = MyCustomFeature()
///     try core.register(feature: feature)
///     core.get(feature: MyCustomFeature.self) // returns feature instance
///
