# Per-subject experimentation opt-out

Select an opt-out mode when creating the Flags client. The default is disabled.
The application owns the subject's preference and timestamp.

```swift
import DatadogFlags

// Initialize Datadog and enable Flags before creating the client.
let client = FlagsClient.create(experimentationOptOutMode: .immediate)

// Omit this attribute when the subject can participate in experimentation.
let context = FlagsEvaluationContext(
    targetingKey: "subject-123",
    attributes: [
        "dd_experimentation_opt_out_at": .string("2026-10-21T12:00:00Z")
    ]
)
client.setEvaluationContext(context) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        let enabled = client.getBooleanValue(key: "new-route-planner", defaultValue: false)
        // Use the assigned ordinary feature value.
    case .failure:
        // Evaluations use the application's defaults when no valid assignments exist.
        break
    }
}
```

| Mode | Behavior when the subject has an opt-out timestamp |
| --- | --- |
| `.disabled` | Ignore the timestamp. |
| `.immediate` | Skip all experiment allocations, including experiments already in progress. |
| `.futureExperimentsOnly` | Skip experiment allocations activated at or after the timestamp, or with an unknown activation time. |

Both enabled modes use the same customer-owned RFC3339 timestamp. A future timestamp does not schedule exclusion.
Use a full `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` date and time, followed by `Z` or a numeric `+HH:mm` or `-HH:mm` offset.
`T` and `Z` may be lowercase. An optional decimal fraction is preserved to nanosecond precision;
additional digits are truncated without rounding. Dates use the proleptic Gregorian calendar,
including year `0000`; both the written date and normalized UTC instant must have years `0000`–`9999`.
Whitespace, leap seconds, named timezones, and invalid calendar fields are rejected.
Acknowledgement timestamps follow the same format and compare the normalized instant.
The Precompute service continues through remaining allocations. If none match, evaluation returns the application's default value.
Future-experiments-only mode leaves older allocations available. It does not prove prior enrollment or preserve a previous assignment.

Malformed strings, nulls, and non-string values return `invalidContext` without making a request.
The SDK does not guess the subject's preference. Disabled mode ignores the attribute.

The Precompute service must acknowledge experimentation opt-out before the client accepts its assignments.
Future mode requires the same mode and cutoff instant, compared at nanosecond precision.
When no opt-out applies, the client rejects responses explicitly marked as filtered for experimentation.
An unsupported service cannot silently return experimental assignments. The SDK uses only cached assignments
that match the current context and opt-out policy. Otherwise it returns application defaults.

Opt-out does not disable evaluation telemetry or RUM flag annotations. Excluded experiment allocations do not produce exposures.
Older allocations retained by future mode still produce their normal exposures. No withdrawal event is added.
Immediate withdrawal can change an enrolled subject's experience. Account for that change in experiment analysis.

Client configuration is fixed for each client name. Creating an existing named client returns its original configuration.
