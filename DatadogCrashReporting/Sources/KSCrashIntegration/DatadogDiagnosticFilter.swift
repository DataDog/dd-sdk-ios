/// A KSCrash filter that generates human-readable diagnostic messages for crash reports.
///
/// This filter is modeled after KSCrash's `KSCrashReportFilterDoctor` and serves the same
/// purpose: analyzing crash reports and producing descriptive diagnostic messages that explain
/// the cause of the crash in plain language.
///
/// ## Crash Types Handled
///
/// 1. **Uncaught Exceptions**: Objective-C/Swift exceptions that weren't caught by the application
///    - Extracts exception name and reason
///    - Format: `"Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'ExceptionName', reason: 'detailed reason'."`
///
/// 2. **Signal-based Crashes**: Low-level crashes caused by Unix signals
///    - Maps signal names to human-readable descriptions (SIGSEGV â†’ Segmentation fault, etc.)
///    - Format: `"Application crash: SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault)"`
///
/// ## Processing Flow
///
/// For each crash report:
/// 1. Validates the report structure
/// 2. Analyzes crash data to determine the crash type
/// 3. Generates an appropriate diagnostic message
/// 4. Injects the diagnosis into both the main crash and recrash reports (if present)
/// 5. Returns the updated report
///
/// ## Integration
///
/// This filter should be placed early in the KSCrash filter chain, before the
/// `DatadogCrashReportFilter`, to ensure diagnostic information is available for
/// subsequent processing and reporting.
