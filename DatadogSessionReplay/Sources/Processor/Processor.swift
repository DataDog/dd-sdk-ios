/// mutation records.

/// The brain of the Session Replay.
///
/// It receives `ViewTreeSnapshots` (VTS) from `Recorder` and turns them
/// into format understood by SR BE, so it can be replayed in the player.
///
/// VTSs processing is following:
/// - the VTS is broke apart into individual view snapshots, mapped into array of SR wireframes (see `WireframesBuilder`);
/// - the array of wireframes is attached to SR record (see `RecordsBuidler`);
/// - succeeding records are enriched with their RUM context and written to `DatadogCore`;
/// - when `DatadogCore` triggers an upload, batched records are deserialized, grouped into SR segments and then uploaded.
