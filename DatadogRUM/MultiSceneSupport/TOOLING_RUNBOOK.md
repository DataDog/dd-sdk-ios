# Multi-scene RUM tooling runbook

Read this document before building, running, or validating the multi-scene probe.
It records the repeatable Xcode, simulator, device-interaction, and Datadog
workflows used by the project. Product behavior and support conclusions belong in
`ASSESSMENT.md`; exact experiment and session identifiers belong in
`EXPERIMENTS.md`.

Last updated: 2026-09-15

## Purpose

The harness must distinguish an SDK defect from stale application state, an
incorrect launch, an expired interaction session, unsupported simulator behavior,
or incomplete backend ingestion. Tooling is therefore part of the experimental
contract.

This runbook has two kinds of guidance:

- Apple Xcode MCP constraints, which the SDK project cannot change.
- Harness adaptations and operating procedures, which this project owns.

## Evidence levels

Never use one evidence level as a substitute for another:

1. A harness assertion proves that the application reached a call site or
   lifecycle state.
2. A mapper event or captured outgoing payload proves which RUM view UUID the SDK
   assigned to an event.
3. Backend intake proves that Datadog accepted and represented the event.
4. A reduced backend entity, such as a RUM Operation, proves reducer semantics and
   may differ from the raw step documents.

A callback count, successful build, local marker, or absence of a crash is not
semantic attribution evidence.

## Xcode MCP preparation

### Select the intended Xcode

When more than one Xcode is installed, pin `DEVELOPER_DIR` or use the intended
Xcode's absolute tool path. Do not infer the selected toolchain from an application
name, and do not assume that `/Applications/Xcode.app` or a remembered
`xcode-select` value points to Xcode 27.

Before an acceptance build, record both:

```sh
xcode-select -p
xcodebuild -version
```

On the 2026-09-15 test host, `/Applications/Xcode.app` was Xcode 26.6
(`17F113`), while `/Applications/Xcode_27.app` was Xcode 27.0 (`27A266a`) and
`xcode-select` selected the latter. A Release build invoked explicitly through the
26.6 installation completed but warned that the iOS 27 deployment target was
unsupported. Treat that result as invalid evidence. The accepted build used
`/Applications/Xcode_27.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild` and the iOS
27.0 simulator SDK.

### Resolve and cache the workspace

1. Call `XcodeListWorkspaces`.
2. Match the returned absolute workspace path to
   `Datadog/Example/MultiSceneProbe/RUMNativeMultiSceneProbe.xcodeproj`.
3. Cache that `workspaceIdentifier` for the current Xcode connection.
4. Pass it to every workspace-aware call.
5. Resolve it again if Xcode, the headless server, or the workspace restarts.

`workspaceIdentifier` is required in practice even where an individual tool's
schema makes it look optional. Never reuse a remembered identifier across Xcode
connections.

### Verify useful access

A listed server or successful tool discovery does not prove that tool calls work.
Verify access with a real call such as `XcodeListWorkspaces`, then list the active
scheme and run destinations. If calls reject or hang, check Xcode's external-agent
permission and headless-server state before investigating the SDK.

### Cache stable selections

For one working session, retain:

- `workspaceIdentifier`;
- active scheme;
- exact simulator or device UUID;
- disambiguated run-destination title;
- probe bundle identifier.

Re-query only when a tool reports a stale identifier, the scheme changes, or the
device topology changes.

## Xcode-provided interaction instructions

Xcode 27 packages a `device-interaction` skill, but it may not be exposed through
MCP resources. Export it before opening a device-interaction session:

```sh
xcrun agent skills export --output-dir /tmp/xcode-agent-skills
```

When the selected Xcode is not the one chosen by `xcode-select`, invoke that
Xcode's `usr/bin/agent` directly or set `DEVELOPER_DIR` first. The output directory
must be absolute. A missing directory is created automatically.

Read the exported `device-interaction/SKILL.md` before driving the device. Do this
once during preparation, not while a short-lived interaction session is open.

## Build, test, and launch workflow

### Fast test loop

1. Use `GetTestList` once and cache exact `targetName` and `testIdentifier` pairs.
2. Use `RunSomeTests` while iterating on focused harness or SDK behavior.
3. Read `fullSummaryPath`, `fullConsoleLogsPath`, and the `.xcresult` path instead
   of relying on truncated inline results.
4. Run `RunAllTests` at the slice checkpoint.
5. Run the repository's authoritative module suites, lint, build, and API checks
   at their planned release gates.

Filter build and console logs at the tool when possible. Avoid transferring or
parsing an entire Xcode log when a severity, pattern, glob, or tail limit can
isolate the evidence.

### Experimental public-API loop

Customer-shaped API experiments may use Swift SPI before normal public API
review. Import those declarations with `@_spi(Experimental)` in the probe and
compile both Debug and Release probe configurations. The Release build is the
proof that the experiment does not depend on `@testable` visibility.

Objective-C has no equivalent SPI import boundary. Keep an Objective-C prototype
Debug-only until API review, exercise its exact generated selectors in the
Objective-C API smoke target, and do not mistake that prototype for an approved
Release API.

Run `make api-surface-verify`, but interpret its result precisely. The current
source-based verifier includes Swift SPI and declarations excluded by `#if DEBUG`;
it therefore reports the experimental Swift and Objective-C declarations
as additions. Do not update checked-in API baselines for a prototype. Confirm
that the diff contains only the expected experimental declarations and treat any
additional difference as a failure. A stable proposal must pass the normal API
review and API-surface gate before release.

### Launch configuration

Supply scenario configuration through `DeviceInteractionInstallAndRun`:

```text
$(inherited)
--probe-scenario <scenario-id>
--probe-run-id <unique-run-id>
--probe-run-mode <clean-or-restoration>
```

Do not edit the shared Xcode scheme for an individual experiment. Preserve
scheme-provided arguments with `$(inherited)`.

Every conclusive attempt must have a unique run ID. A relaunch that intentionally
continues the same attempt may reuse its run ID only when the scenario contract
explicitly permits it.

## Clean-run precondition

For scenarios whose default run mode is `clean`:

1. Resolve the exact target-device UUID.
2. Terminate the probe if it is running.
3. Uninstall its bundle from that exact target.
4. Verify that querying the application container reports that it does not exist.
5. Start or reuse the workspace interaction session.
6. Install and launch the requested scenario.

If Xcode must start a workspace session before it reveals the target UUID, that
session may remain open while steps 2–4 run. The acceptance boundary is that the
uninstall and missing-container proof occur before `InstallAndRun`; merely opening
a device session does not contaminate application state.

Failure to establish the clean precondition invalidates the attempt. It is not an
SDK failure.

An uninstall and missing application-container proof do not guarantee that the
simulator window server discarded every value previously persisted for a SwiftUI
`WindowGroup`. The probe must normalize each restored window value to the current
launch's run ID before using it as telemetry. Preserve the original routed value
only for SwiftUI window identity and dismissal. Backend validation must still
inspect every view in the resulting session and reject a run if any semantic view
retains another run ID.

Restoration scenarios must use their documented predecessor run and restoration
state instead of this clean sequence.

## Device-interaction workflow

Device-interaction sessions can expire quickly. Complete all code review, skill
loading, coordinate strategy, scenario selection, and expected-result preparation
before starting one.

Use this sequence without unrelated work between calls:

1. `DeviceInteractionStartWorkspaceSession`
2. `DeviceInteractionInstallAndRun`
3. `DeviceInteractionSynthesize` with no command to capture live state
4. Read the hierarchy and confirm the expected accessibility identifier
5. `DeviceInteractionSynthesize` with the prepared interaction
6. Capture the post-interaction hierarchy, logs, and screenshots
7. Wait only as required by the scenario's observable terminal result
8. `DeviceInteractionEndSession`

The start call returns the exact interaction key. Apple currently names the key
parameter differently across its APIs:

| Call | Key parameter |
| --- | --- |
| `DeviceInteractionInstallAndRun` | `interactionSessionKey` |
| `DeviceInteractionSynthesize` | `interactSessionKey` |
| `DeviceInteractionEndSession` | `interactionSessionKey` |

Preserve the spelling from each live schema. Do not normalize the parameter name
in raw calls.

Trust the exact value returned in `interactionSessionKey`, even when it happens
to equal the human-readable session identifier rather than looking opaque. Retry
`StartWorkspaceSession` only after another call reports that returned key invalid
or expired.

### Fully automated scenarios

A signal-driven scenario that needs no external touch does not require a
`Synthesize` call merely to advance it. After the clean precondition:

1. start the workspace interaction session;
2. install and run with the exact scenario arguments;
3. read filtered console output until the terminal result or bounded timeout;
4. capture hierarchy/screenshot only when visual state is evidence for the row;
5. end the interaction session.

Follow the live Xcode MCP instruction about delegating device interaction even
for an automated run. The delegate owns only device state and artifacts; source
editing and semantic interpretation remain with the main task.

### Coordinate and gesture rules

Always capture the current hierarchy before interacting. Use an element's reported
hit point or bounds; never guess from a screenshot. If multiple applications are
present and the hierarchy provides an `activationBundleId`, activate that bundle
before interacting with its element.

The documented commands used by this project include:

```text
t <x> <y> [duration]                     tap or hold
d <x> <y>                                double tap
t <x1> <y1> f <x2> <y2> [duration]      swipe
w <duration>                             wait
```

Example upward swipe:

```text
t 200 600 f 200 200 0.3
```

Choose both swipe endpoints inside the measured scrollable element. The duration
is part of the experiment: a deceleration scenario needs a fast gesture, while a
drag-and-drop scenario needs a slower dedicated command.

After any interaction, capture again and confirm its effect. Retry at most once
when the evidence proves that the first interaction had no effect. Do not retry a
gesture merely because the SDK result was unexpected.

`interactionCommand: "help"` is not supported and does not return command syntax.

### Expired sessions

`Session not found` before an interaction means the gesture was not performed. It
does not consume the scenario's gesture retry and is not an SDK failure.

Recover by:

1. Starting a fresh workspace interaction session.
2. Reinstalling and relaunching the same prepared scenario.
3. Capturing the live hierarchy again.
4. Recomputing or confirming coordinates from that new hierarchy.
5. Performing the prepared interaction immediately.

If `DeviceInteractionEndSession` reports that the session no longer exists after
a successful capture, record it as automatic tooling expiration. The captured
artifacts remain valid.

## Scenario interaction recipes

Every scenario requiring external interaction should declare or document:

- required capability, such as `nativeUIKitGesture`;
- assertion or signal that proves the destination is ready;
- target accessibility identifier;
- gesture type and speed requirement;
- coordinate rule based on the target bounds;
- maximum retry count;
- timeout and terminal-result condition;
- simulator, physical-device, or human requirement;
- conditions that make the run inconclusive.

The application must publish a readiness barrier before external input is
accepted. Reaching a screen name is insufficient when the interactive UIKit or
SwiftUI element has not mounted yet.

Prefer an XCTest UI or `xcui` driver for repeatable simulator interactions when it
exercises the same production gesture path. Use Xcode device interaction for
physical devices, visual inspection, and experiments requiring its device
capabilities.

## Simulator, device, and human routing

Do not repeatedly run a topology the simulator cannot express.

Classify each experiment as one of:

- simulator-capable and automated;
- simulator-capable with one real external gesture;
- physical-device required;
- human-driven physical-device required.

If the simulator cannot maintain simultaneous windows, generate an analog touch,
perform a cancellation gesture, or preserve deceleration across a transition,
record the exact limitation and put the unchanged experiment in the physical or
human rerun queue. `INCONCLUSIVE` is the correct result; `PASS` and `FAIL` are not.

The harness should continue to own deterministic setup, run IDs, assertions,
payload capture, and backend validation even when a human supplies the gesture.

## Run artifacts

Each attempt should produce one compact machine-readable summary containing:

- scenario ID and unique run ID;
- Git revision and dirty-state note;
- device UUID, model, and OS;
- clean or restoration mode;
- terminal `PASS`, `FAIL`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, or `INVALID` result;
- expectation count and failed expectation identifiers;
- RUM session ID when available;
- hierarchy, console-log, screenshot, summary, and `.xcresult` paths;
- local mapper/payload validation status;
- backend ingestion and reducer validation status;
- reason and rerun instructions for invalid or inconclusive attempts.

Exact run IDs, RUM session IDs, and artifact evidence belong in
`EXPERIMENTS.md`. Higher-level documents should cite the stable `EXP-*` identifier
instead of duplicating volatile identifiers.

## Datadog validation workflow

Use the unique probe run attribute as the primary search key. Application name and
timestamps are secondary discriminators.

RUM and APM index the probe's run identifier under different attributes:

- RUM: `@context.probe.run_id:<run-id>`;
- APM spans: `@probe.run_id:<run-id>` and the exact `@http.url` as an independent
  retry discriminator.

Do not substitute the APM form in a RUM query. For Trace-only URLSession rows,
also aggregate the exact URL in RUM and require zero matching Resource events.

For each run:

1. Find the RUM session and record concise identifying metadata.
2. Retrieve the relevant view, action, Resource, error, long-task, vital, and
   Operation documents with the run-ID query.
3. Independently query `@session.id:<session-id> @type:view`. Verify that every
   expected occurrence is present and that each semantic view document carries
   the current run ID. A run-ID aggregate alone can hide a view whose start
   attributes were contaminated by restored state.
4. Compare event view UUIDs with the local mapper evidence.
5. For Operations, compare raw `operation_step` documents with the reduced
   Operation result.
6. Verify exact counts, occurrence IDs, start/end ownership, and the absence of
   unexpected duplicate events.
7. Check for RUM errors, crashes, or SDK telemetry that could invalidate the run.

If an exact application-name query returns nothing, retry authentication and
broaden the query before concluding that the session is absent. Account for intake
latency with bounded retries; do not poll indefinitely.

Save reusable Datadog query shapes without credentials. Never copy API keys,
authorization headers, cookies, or complete customer payloads into documentation.

## Failure classification

Use these categories consistently:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS` | Every required semantic expectation is proven at its declared evidence level |
| `FAIL` | The intended platform path occurred, but the SDK or backend violated the contract |
| `INCONCLUSIVE` | The environment could not exercise or distinguish the required behavior |
| `INVALID` | Setup, launch configuration, stale state, tooling, or oracle construction broke the experiment |

Examples that are not SDK failures:

- wrong or omitted scenario argument;
- stale installed application;
- missing clean-install proof;
- expired interaction session before the gesture;
- gesture never reaching the intended element;
- simulator reporting no deceleration for a required deceleration experiment;
- multi-window compositor closing a scene before the decisive step;
- backend query attempted before ingestion or with expired authentication;
- oracle checking the wrong event type, count, interval, or occurrence.

When the simulator window server (`backboardd`) crashes, inspect its `.ips` and
look separately for an application `.ips`, fatal/assertion output, mapper error,
and backend RUM crash/error event. One clean retry is reasonable when the same
topology has previously worked. An identical second system-process crash before
the decisive signal moves the unchanged row to capable physical hardware; it is
not an SDK crash or semantic result.

Invalid and inconclusive attempts must still be documented so later work does not
repeat them.

## Security and repository hygiene

Never stage or commit:

- `xcconfigs/Datadog.local.xcconfig`;
- credentials or authentication material;
- captured intake request bodies or headers;
- simulator application containers;
- screenshots, hierarchy dumps, console logs, or `.xcresult` bundles;
- temporary exported Xcode skills.

Store artifacts in temporary or ignored local directories. Documentation may
record their local paths for the current handoff, but only durable, sanitized
conclusions and identifiers belong in Git.

Before committing harness or documentation work, inspect the exact staged paths
and keep unrelated project-file or local-configuration changes outside the commit.

## Known Apple Xcode MCP constraints

These are operating constraints, not SDK backlog items:

- interaction sessions may expire while preparation is still in progress;
- the session lifetime and remaining time are not exposed;
- an expired session may be reported only as `Session not found`;
- device-interaction command grammar may require exporting Xcode's packaged skill;
- `interactionCommand: "help"` does not provide that grammar;
- the interaction key parameter has inconsistent names across calls;
- workspace identifiers become stale when the workspace or Xcode service restarts;
- the advertised tool set is dynamic;
- a successful connection or tool listing does not prove the agent is authorized
  to make useful calls.

Do not create project tasks to change these Apple-owned APIs. Adapt the harness and
runbook around them.
