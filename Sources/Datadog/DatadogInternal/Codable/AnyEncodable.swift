/**
 A type-erased `Encodable` value.
 The `AnyEncodable` type forwards encoding responsibilities
 to an underlying value, hiding its specific underlying type.
 You can encode mixed-type values in dictionaries
 and other collections that require `Encodable` conformance
 by declaring their contained type to be `AnyEncodable`:
     let dictionary: [String: AnyEncodable] = [
         "boolean": true,
         "integer": 42,
         "double": 3.141592653589793,
         "string": "string",
         "array": [1, 2, 3],
         "nested": [
             "a": "alpha",
             "b": "bravo",
             "c": "charlie"
         ],
         "null": nil
     ]
